- hi, i'm ssulfurine. i'm a student looking to utilize github for future projects to do with creation and preservation of content, as well as to familiarize myself with many different web development platforms.
- i greatly enjoy english and human culture. i have an open mind to many different skills, so i am doing my best to work with the code/web development presentation on this site.
